# My-First-Program
The first computer program i have ever coded - 2017.

The latest version of the program had 2500 lines but i lost it. I did not know the switch-case structure and memory management. So the program has some memory leaks. I coded it in the mobile phone via borland c++ compiler in 2-3 months.
